# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard
Conducted bank customer churn visualization using Power BI, translating raw data into actionable insights.

Project Overview: This project involves conducting customer churn analysis using raw data from a bank's customers. The dataset contains essential attributes such as customer ID, credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of products, credit card ownership, activity status, estimated salary, and churn status.
Data Preparation and Analysis: The raw data is imported into Power BI for analysis. Using Power Query Editor, the data is cleaned, organized, and transformed to ensure its suitability for modeling and analysis. This process involves tasks such as removing unnecessary columns, promoting headers, and handling data types.
Modeling and Visualization: Once the data is prepared, it is modeled for analysis within Power BI. Reference tables and measures are created to calculate key metrics, including churn rate. Data visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into customer demographics and behavior. Visualizations such as donut charts and bar charts are utilized to represent the distribution of customers and analyze factors contributing to churn.
Dashboard Creation: A comprehensive dashboard is created in Power BI to consolidate the visualizations and present the analysis findings. The dashboard includes interactive features such as filters and titles to enhance usability. Users can explore the data dynamically and gain deeper insights into customer churn patterns and trends.
